# Holbie-Auctions

Hello everyone.

Today we want yo present you, our nascent business: holbie auctions!....
a place where the companies can sell their obsolete inventories or old products, using a web site to interact with the buyers.

The problem we identified is You only find exclusive sites of auctions.... Only specialized matters or products like art, technical issues, etc., And those sites has limit times and the auctions are so closed.

We want to Open this kind of practices, giving You the oporttunity  to sell all kind of products, with no limits of time, no subscriptions, no matter the type and for everyone!

We don not want to compite with Big platforms....we just want to offer a different way to help industry yo sell the old products and leak inventories, with simple steps.

The advantages of our product are:

Easy to use.

Fast response.

Any kind of product, except animals or human organs.

At anytime.

With no limit dates.


The companies only just give the inventory of products to our staff in a .xls format. We take that information and we convert that in a format to be  readed in Mongo.db, and after that we can publish in our web site to colect the offers and that's all!

Here You can see a demo of the code, and the function of the web site.....like You see is easy to use.
Here You can find the administrator registration option too.

We are a commitment group of 3 students who want to be part of the auctions sales market.

We are Santiago, Marcela and Carlos

The technologies we used for this proyect was: ........

Holbie auctions..... A different way of auctions in the market!!!!!

Thanks to everyone!
